After the confirmation of an Ebola case in the United States, and by USA I mean America, the federal government of Xochimilco, and with the national government approvement, have made a whole plant in the Centro Nacional de Atención a Quemados, located in the Instituto Nacional de Rehabilitación.<br>
<br>
<br>
As it is already know, the Ebola is a disease that causes fever, muscles aches, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and internal destruction of the tissues.<br>
<br>
<br>
The plant is closed and it has 20 bed, specialist and nurses, which, by the way, count with especial suits, machines, and all needed equipment to attend an Ebola infected without a risk.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mexico can still be considered as a free Ebola country, and yet, precautions have been taken by the proximity with the USA.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, if there is an Ebola case anywhere in Mexico, they have gotten the equipment to transport it to the Center and give the necessary attention.
